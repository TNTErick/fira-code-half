# Fira Code Half
Fira Code Half is fira code with all* the ligatures and features, but fits into half of a square.
This allows people to mix it with other CJK, without breaking any monospace-ity.

## Features
These files are pulled from release version 6.2 of [Fira Code](/tonsky/FiraCode/) project.
The files are guaranteed to have align up to half the width of [Noto Sans](/notofonts/noto-cjk)
