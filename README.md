# Fira Code Half
Fira Code Half is fira code with all* the ligatures and features, but fits into half of a square.
This allows people to mix it with other CJK, without breaking any monospace-ity.

Inspired by [Ricty Diminished with Fira Code](https://github.com/hakatashi/RictyDiminished-with-FiraCode), but this project allows you to freely choose your own CJK font by setting it as the fallback font.

## Features
These files are pulled from release version 6.2 of [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) project.
The files are guaranteed to have align up to half the width of [Noto Sans CJK](https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk).
